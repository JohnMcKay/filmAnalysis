# Film Data Analysis
Welcome to my side project! This is not anything fancy, I just like movies and want to practice my R and python skills. 
The plan is to have two parts: a __statistical analysis__ section where I use R to model the data 
and figure out what correlates with what and a __film forcaster__ where I create a machine learning 
algorithm to try to predict how movies will fair (IMDB scoring-wise) given a set of features.

# Data
For now I'm testing out the python module <tt>tmdbsimple</tt>. Details can be had [here](https://pypi.org/project/tmdbsimple/).

# Repository Design
For both R and python, I've broken this repository into two: /development and /toolbox. The dev folder has my in-progress functions while /toolbox has the finalized code.

# Progress
* __10/04/2018__ Created repository and started testing <tt>tmdbsimple</tt>.
